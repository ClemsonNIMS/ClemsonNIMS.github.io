      <p>
        NIMS seeks to connect students with resources they might not be aware of. Clemson has so many amazing groups, clubs, shops and opportunities that it's hard to keep track of them all. That's where we come in; your one-stop-shop for all things making, learning and playing at Clemson.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also provide services for student organizations and clubs. We want to connect people with a passion to create, and use this energy to drive  improvements that benefit everyone. NIMS aims to champion student groups and leverage the Network to get dedicated space, resources and funding.

      <p>
      Our main focus is facilitating the exposure of resources available to Clemson University students. We have conducted extensive interviews to identify spaces open to student from any major and the tools they provide. Whether you're looking for woodworing tools, a space to record your music video, or where to 3D print a model of your own head, NIMS has got you covered. Take a look out our resources section to begin exploring!

      <p>
      We love to show off all the amazing things Clemson students are making, and have hosted several events aimed at doing just that. Since NIMS is primarily a network we strive to promote interaction between groups who are designing combat robots, innovating in the education field, or just having fun building! Take a look at some of the events we've put on, and sign up on our newsletter to hear about our future plans.
